# Evictions
Python scripts to help tenants fight evictions

**Hamilton County OH Future Evictions Scraper for GitHub:** With the CDC's eviction moratorium declared in September, I wanted to reach out to renters who were facing eviction to let them know this was an option.
**How it works:** given a date or range of dates, goes to the Hamilton County, OH Clerk of Courts website and scrapes information for evictions for the date/range of dates, then goes to a website with peoples' contact info and looks up their phone number and/or email address.  

**Evictions EDA and Geocode:** Exploring Eviction Lab data, information about Hamilton County apartments and a shapefile of Hamilton County.  Returns a csv of geocoded apartment buildings in Hamilton county

**Find Apartment Buildings by Zip Codes for GitHub:** I had some friends looking to canvas large apartments in certain neighborhoods.  To help them know where to go, I used information from the Hamilton County Auditor's website, the spreadsheet generated by **Evictins EDA and Geocode**, and the voter file from the Secretary of State's website to identify large apartment buildings, their addresses, and the people who live there.  
**How it works:** takes the output csv from **Evictins EDA and Geocode**, files from the Auditor's website, and the Hamilton County voter file, and returns an excel file of large apartment buildings with subsequent tabs showing the names and apartments of people who live there according to the voter file.
